Math Editor
==========

An equation editor for creating mathematical and scientific documents.

Math Editor is a free alternative to expensive commercial products like MathType. It allows you to typeset almost all kinds of equations.

This fork is currently being worked on, and is set to address minor features that were missing in original version.

Somewhat implemented features:

- Multiple tabs

Planned features:

- Highlighters
- Customizable shortcuts

The architecture of Math Editor has been explained in this article on The Code Project: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/522345/OOP-in-the-Real-World-Creating-an-Equation-Editor
